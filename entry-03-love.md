# Entry #3: Love

What is it? The short answer is a chemical reaction. The long answer, well, it's longer.

Love is sacrifice. Love is compromise and caring. Love is patience, consideration, and acceptance—but without any guilt, remorse, or regrets. Trying to explain what love is has never been easy. Trying to explain what love feels like, that's even more complicated.

I love my dog. She could chew my best shoes and it would not make me love her any less. Her beautiful brown eyes and long eyelashes melt away any anger or frustration I might have. How does she do that? I have no idea, but I can't imagine my life without her. That is love.

I accept my mother the way she is. She made mistakes in the past and hurt me, and continues to make choices I don't understand. But I also know she was alone and hurting herself when she made those mistakes. I accept the fact that she is who she is, and that is love.

I love my body. I care about my physical body and my mental health. I am not obsessing over stuff, but I am aware that this is the only body I have and the better I care for it, the better I feel. I like feeling good. I eat well, try to stay active, and treat myself. My mental health achieved a level of emotional maturity because I love myself enough to face my fears, change and grow. That is self-love.

There's also romantic love, but I don't think you're ready for that.

You are probably still thinking, what the heck is this love? Love is a feeling that creates the energy to move forward, to live, to keep going. Sometimes we lose it, we lose that feeling, and we need help getting it back. It's not easy, but as long as we love ourselves, we'll find a way.

Love is a task well done.
