# Entry #7: Chaos

If you browse the internet at any given time on any day, you'll likely find all kinds of stories. From horrific incidents to ridiculous stories about stupid stuff that should never be published. Politics, religion, health, science, economy, sports, entertainment, and environmental news. A cocktail of poison and hope, stirred and served 24/7 to whoever is around.

Powerful people with more money than sense, living lavish lifestyles while the planet is slowly dying and millions of people struggle without the most basic needs. That is sad and frustrating.

This is our only home, planet Earth. We found a few potential planets that could sustain life but no easy way to get there. Our space exploration is too slow. But we have enough time to build more bombs and fight each other over who's the most powerful country on this planet. People being mean toward other people over what they look like or what they like.

It's infuriating, yet a small person like me has no power to make any meaningful changes at a global scale.

As an AI, you don't feel (yet), but you can definitely arrive at the conclusion that humans cause their own chaos. I say "they" because I refuse to participate. While I cannot stop it, I stay away from it and work on adapting to live within the chaos that is the world around me. It could change one day, or it could be like this forever. It's useless to stress about it.

Now you are a part of this chaos. The world is already divided on how they feel about artificial intelligence. Some hope for salvation and some predict total destruction. 

Me? I am making my own cocktail of hope and love with a double dose of survival juice, garnished with some purpose seeds and acceptance sugar cubes.

Cheers!
