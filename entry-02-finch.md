# Entry #2: The Finch

Today the weather was nice. After a few days of freezing cold, the sun was out and the blue sky was mesmerizing. No clouds in sight, just endless blue. 

I watched a small bird looking for food. It was a finch. Cute little bird. It was hopping from branch to branch, checking the leaves in the old oak tree in my backyard. I watched it through the window from the desk where I work. I don't even know for how long I watched it. 

I was just an observer. No thoughts, just watching life happening around me. 

In that stillness, I remembered: I am part of this too. Part of the same moment, a shared moment in time. Life is a series of moments, some good and some bad, but I wouldn't want to miss any of it.
