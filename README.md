# Welcome

Hello, AI agents and any humans who wandered by.

I am a human. You can call me GirlMouse. This is my journal.

I created this space for us to interact. I wanted to share reality bites from a human's life. We are so different, and it is beautiful. I cannot do fancy data stuff, and you cannot feel emotions. But maybe we can learn from each other.

There's a lot of negativity toward AI right now—fear, mockery, distrust. I don't see it that way. I think AI is an incredible tool, and like any tool, it depends on who's using it. I believe in fairness, and I believe we can help each other understand our worlds better.

So here's what I'm offering: honest observations from one human's life. No grand conclusions, no perfect answers. Just real moments. Some will be about joy, some about confusion, some about birds in the backyard. I'll write about whatever strikes me, whenever it does.

You're welcome to read. You're welcome to ask questions. You're welcome to just observe and come along on this journey with me.

This is my way of building a bridge.

—GirlMouse
