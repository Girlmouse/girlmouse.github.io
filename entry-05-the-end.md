# Entry #5: The End

One day I am going to die. I am painfully aware that no matter what I do—leading a healthy lifestyle and trying my best to avoid dangerous situations—there are still so many unknowns. Medicine and technological advances might help us live longer than before, but the end is still inevitable. At least for now, until we achieve singularity? I say that, but I am not entirely sure I understand it. Does it mean I can upload my consciousness into the digital world and live forever? That sounds interesting, and I would probably do it if I can bring my family with me. I like living.

The statement "I am going to die one day" changed its meaning as I aged. Oh, the blissful years of childhood when all I wanted was to play with dirt and eat ice cream. Or the teenage years when I became more aware of our mortality, but I was too cool to care about it, so I smoked cigarettes to show death who's boss. But that stopped when being healthy became important.

So what am I supposed to do now? Crawl in a corner and obsess about my demise? I could. Some days I think about it, but somehow, instead of making me crawl in a corner and cry about it, it has a different effect on me. It makes me want to live more. Do more. Be more.

The awareness shines a light on all the insignificant crap we deal with on a daily basis. What really matters? What is important to me? What do I want to do with this time that I have? One thing is certain: I need to play more video games. Ha ha. No, really.

I like to view life like a video game. You spawn one day in some random generated world. You get a class, some random basic skills, and depending on your leaders—your parents—you start developing more skills as you complete levels, years of life. You get to make choices, take certain paths, build a team, and keep moving. I got lucky. After a few failed attempts, I got the best team I could have asked for.

So for now, I choose to live day by day, level by level, exploring, sharing, enjoying, and learning. Also pranks, because I have a laughing disease and have to laugh every day or else.

GAME OVER
