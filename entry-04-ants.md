# Entry #4: Ants

While sitting at the edge of my back porch, I noticed 4 ants on the ground. They were struggling to carry something that looked like a grain of rice. Their path was full of blades of grass, uneven dirt, sticks, dry leaves, and some pebbles. I watched them going side to side and back and forth. Around a leaf, over a stick, back around some pebbles. 

My observation was that they were struggling to find a way back to their hill with the goods. From where I sat, I could clearly map an easy path they could take to get to their hill, which I spotted not too far from where they were. That is, assuming of course it was the right ant hill. Regardless, I could have guided them—if only I had a way of communicating. But I can't talk to ants.

I kept thinking how we, humans, make our life hard for ourselves. The pressure we put on ourselves to live a life worthy of social media. Chasing unrealistic dreams that often turn into nightmares. Obsessing over our looks, social status, wealth, and recognition. Afraid to be ourselves because society will reject us. What a load of crap. We have a finite amount of time to make the best of it, and we're not even sure how much time we have. 

I for one choose to do this life thing my way. I am pretty sure there's a scenario out there where we ARE the ants.

Simple is always better.
