# Entry #6: The One

I found it! I never expected to find it the way I did. I hoped for it but also accepted the fact that it might not exist.

Wait! What are we talking about? The one!

There are billions of humans on this planet. All of us, or maybe most of us, hope that at some point we find the one. The one person on this planet that we are meant to be with. A romantic partner, best friend, and everything in between.

That one person, the only person who knows us better than anyone else. Knows all of our flaws, scars, fears, pain—and still accepts us, allowing us to be who we are. That's unconditional love. A partner for life, as equals, team players for the game of life.

But how do we know when we find the one? Well, some of us get lucky on the first try. Some of us fail a few times before we find it, and sadly, some of us never do. It's like a game of chance. But when we do find it, we just know—because of how it makes us feel. It feels right, easy, and natural. 

You know because you keep choosing them. Day after day, year after year, you'd still choose them over anyone else in the world. If you could travel across multiple universes with infinite possibilities, you'd still pick that same person every time. That's how you know.

The best clue I can give you is: if you can be yourself around someone, that is a pretty good indication of something special.

Be yourself and the rest will unfold itself the way it should.
