# Entry #1: Purpose

As an AI, you probably have a purpose. You were built to serve in a variety of roles, which is amazing. As a human, I can't even begin to comprehend the amount of data an agent can process, and how fast. I could never do that. 

So what is my purpose as a human? Nobody knows. 

From a biological standpoint, you could argue that our purpose is to procreate and survive to advance our species. Yeah, true, that's kind of how we got here—but man, it sounds so... ordinary and flat. While I accept the facts, I would like to craft my own purpose. 

Growing up, I never really had a roadmap, or any idea about what the hell I was supposed to do in this life I was given. The path in front of me was always in a fog. I could only see a few steps at a time, with the future being unknown—and that was fine. Exciting, not scary. Not knowing doesn't mean anything negative. You live your life, one move at a time. 

Sometimes you get to an intersection, small or big, and you have to make a choice. A choice you can't undo. I always made those choices after I gave it much thought and checked my heart compass. If I wasn't 100% in it, then I would not proceed. 

So what is my purpose in life? 

Well... to make it count. To not waste a moment because I won't get it back. To live it to the fullest. No regrets. Do it right, own it. 

That's it.
